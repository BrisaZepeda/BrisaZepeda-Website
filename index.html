        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology ðŸ§ </div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Second year psychology student, with interest in research about cognitive studies including behavior, decision-making, and memory, made the Dean's list of honors for two years and maintained a grade point average above 3.5. I am part of an honors group at UCR called PsychChi that unites psychology majors for meetings and information about graduate school and alternate career paths as well as mentoring. Dedicated and eager to start in the field of psychology through research and internship opportunities across Southern California. Planning on continuing my education with a master's and doctoral degree at UC San Diego. I also have interest in working with children, tutoring high school students in various interdisciplinary subjects including math, sciences, and Spanish. I effectively prepared them for midterms and final exams, in which they increased their test scores by over 10% in the past two years. As a bilingual student communicating and developing relationships particularly with ESL students and their families is also one of my goals as a student tutor since I am a first generation college student who also started in ESL. Tutoring high school students is especially interesting to me because they are essentially in between two stages of development, having a of guidance counselor gives students a safe space to express themselves and feel included.<br><br>

        Currently employed for over a year at Old Navy, where I acquired marketing, organizational, and effective customer service skills. This company appealed to me because I love to work with people and make 'magic moments' during their shopping experiences by using the motto 'Customer Yes.' It is my ultimate goal to establish an equal and inclusive shopping experience for all customers at my store, while also promoting our latest deals to increase sales. As part of the marketing team I helped with repricing, signage, and inventory to guarantee that customers leave the store with a smile on their face and more money saved. Working for Gap Inc. requires an Open to All mindset which drives every aspect of business and my career. When we include and respect people from all walks of life, we create a better, stronger company and a better, stronger world.<br><br>

        As a sales associate, I have experience in opening credit cards for customers and was named employee of the month for two consecutive months for enrolling over 30 customers in Navyist rewards programs. Also, at Old Navy I was named a lead for my year of service towards the company and excelling in store visuals, assisting in advertising and cash handling. As a lead for our store, I make sure that all our product is folded according to meticulous standards to ensure the most efficient quality and experience while also training new hires how to fill out applications for rewards. I have taken part in volunteering with the company and raising money through donations and toy drives for low-income families during the holidays.
